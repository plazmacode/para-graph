BUGS:
---BUG 2 --- in Highlight.js: Highlighting also puts a <span> around any HTML tags
DESC: 
Only a problem if the user inputs rich text which contains HTML tags


FIXED BUGS:

---BUG 1 --- in PgInput.js: Empty words after change to contentEditable p element
FIX: add word !== "" (phrase delimiter for empty words) in WordFrequency.js
FIX: add trim() to .innerText
FIX: add text.replace(/\n/g, ' ') in WordFrequency.js
DESC:
Still bugged from + characters
Firefox creates a <br> tag when deleting in a contentEditable
Cannot delete first letter in contentEditable similiar bug?: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1394758
single letter (or word) input gives barcount of 2?
deleting that letter does not give an empty query, which should show API query of canvas for text input
this might be because of the query dependency not calling useEffect as expected
